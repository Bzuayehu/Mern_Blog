      `To quickly run a Node.js server in 10 minutes, first, 
        set up your project by creating a new folder and initializing it with npm init -y
        to generate a package.json file. Next, install Express, a popular Node.js web framework, 
        with npm install express. Create a new file like server.js and write a basic server code 
        using Express. This code sets up a server listening on port 3000 and responds with "Hello, 
        World!" to incoming requests. Finally, run the server by executing node server.js in the 
        terminal and access it in a web browser at http://localhost:3000 to see your 
        "Hello, World!" message displayed. This quick setup allows you to launch a Node.js 
        server swiftly and gain practical experience with server-side development using Node.js 
        and Express.`,
